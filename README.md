A repository of exam review sheets and other resources compiled by students at the University of South Florida
in the Computer Science and Computer Engineering programs.

With development initially starting in Summer of 2024, this repository aims to increase the passing rate of the courses
within these programs through the creation of comprehensive and easily digestible study guides, flashcards,
and practice questions.

These materials are not intended to replace independent study, but to complement it
by ensuring that all information is covered and understood.

As of November 2024, this repository contains materials covering:

- EGN 3443, Probability & Statistics for Engineers
- COP 3514, Program Design
- CDA 3103, Computer Organization & Architecture
- COT 3100, Intro to Discrete Structures
